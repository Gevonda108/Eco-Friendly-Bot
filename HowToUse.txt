📦 How To Use — Eco-Friendly Discord AI Bot 🤖🌿

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Eco-Friendly Bot, a Discord bot that uses AI (ResNet) to recognize electronic devices and help raise environmental awareness.

📁 Project Structure

EcoFriendlyBOT/
│
├── Bot/                  # Contains bot-related files (like bot.py)
├── datasets/             # Training images sorted by categories (e.g., smartphone, laptop)
├── env/                  # Your virtual environment (not needed for users to upload)
├── Labels/               # Contains 'labels.txt' mapping classes
├── Resnet/               # Trained model file (resnet_model.pth)
└── bot.py                # Main file to run the Discord bot

✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

1. Python 3.8+ installed

2. A Discord bot token (create one at https://discord.com/developers)

3. Git & pip installed

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. 🔁 Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Gevonda108/Eco-Friendly-Bot.git
cd Eco-Friendly-Bot

🧪 Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
# Create
python -m venv env

# Activate
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

📦 Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install discord.py torch torchvision pillow

client.run("YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")

🧠 Ensure Model & Dataset Are in Place

* Resnet/resnet_model.pth: This is your trained model file.

* datasets/: Must contain folders for each class (e.g., smartphone, tv, etc.) — these are used if you retrain or augment the model.

* Labels/labels.txt: A text file listing all the class labels.

* Make sure all these exist in the proper folders before running the bot.

python bot.py

📎 Notes

* If you want to retrain the ResNet model, make sure to:
  * Use the datasets/ folder for image categories.
  * Export the model to Resnet/resnet_model.pth.
* This bot uses basic computer vision to identify devices from images users upload in Discord.

🧼 Troubleshooting

* Missing torch or discord module?
  Run pip install torch torchvision discord.py

* Model not found error?
  Ensure resnet_model.pth is in the Resnet/ directory.

* Bot not starting?
  Double-check your Discord bot token in bot.py.
